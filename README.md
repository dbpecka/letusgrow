# LetUsGrow
**A schedule and automation controller to make the LettuceGrow Tower even better**

---

### Summary
The [Lettuce Grow](https://www.lettucegrow.com) hydroponic farmstands
are an elegant and super-easy way to introduce yourself to hydroponic growing; 
all you need are plant seedings, water, food/nutrient, and Ph up/down solution.
Still, if you're like me, negligence can lead to returning from vacation to 
a towering of dead lettuce and herbs.

Enter LetUsGrow, a scheduling and automation controller to make the Lettuce Grow
even lazier. LetUsGrow, at its core, is a relay controller to manage schedules
of lights, pumps, and chemistry measurement in/on your tower.

### Current Functionality
- Relay control of:
  - Lights
  - Pumps
  - Dosing Pumps
- Two-tiered schedule for daytime and nighttime settings/intervals

### In Development
- Water level measurement
- TDS measurement
- Remote monitoring and telemetry push
